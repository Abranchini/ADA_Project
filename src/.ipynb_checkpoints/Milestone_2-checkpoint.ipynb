    "In this notebook we present our pipeline to answer the research questions that we raised in Milestone 1. In the first part, we show our step-step strategy on how we proceed to answer the individual questions. In the second part, the code we used to fetch the data and to do the preliminary analysis is provided. In the third part we present our preliminary statistical analysis, as well as some visualizations of our exploratory data analysis."
