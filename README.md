# Let's get emotional


# Abstract

### Brainstorm ideas

Good news: we can extract per event the target country (country where the event is happening) and the source country with the corresponding average tone. 


# Research question


Possible research questions: 

1. Are we emotionally biased?
- Do the number of conflicts define our emotions, or are is there an underlying trend of a more positive or negative news perception over time?

2. Are some countries ignored in the news panel? 
- Can we observe that the number of conflicts in a country is not in relation with the number of mentions in the media depending on where the conflict has happened? 

3. Are we emotionally predictable?
- Can we observe patterns of emotions given a country, a religion, an ethnical group, ... in response to a conflict (features of conflict to be defined) and can we derive a model predicting emotions in case of a new conflict?

4. Research question correlating the average tone with a specific event/ ethnical group/mfamous person/ dictator 
TO BE DEFINED

# Questions to the TA

1. How old is the GDELT dataset in the cluster? When is it updated?
2. Do we have access to the 2300 emotions provided for each event? GDELT mentions that: "users interested in emotional measures use the Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records"
