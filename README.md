# Abstract

### Brainstorm ideas

Good news: we can extract per event the target country (country where the event is happening) and the source country with the corresponding average tone. 


# Research question


Possible research questions: 

1. Are we emotionally biased?
Do the number of conflicts define our emotions, or are is there an underlying trend of a more positive or negative news perception over time?

2. Are some countries ignored in the news panel? 
Can we observe that the number of conflicts in a country is not in relation with the number of mentions in the media depending on where the conflict has happened? 

3. Are we emotionally predictable?
Can we observe patterns of emotions given a country, a religion, an ethnical group, ... in response to a conflict (features of conflict to be defined) and can we derive a model predicting emotions in case of a new conflict?

4. Research question correlating the average tone with a specific event/ ethnical group/mfamous person/ dictator 
TO BE DEFINED

5. Is there some emotional saturation?
Does having a lot of few conflicts affect how people feel about it? If there are many conflicts in one place people get used to it and do not react to it as strongly as in places it occurs less often.

Marie Idea: 

- In line with: are we emotionally biased? If we select some countries important in the global political spectrum (e.g. Germany, Russia, Brazil and US) and we look at the timeline (e.g. 1990 until today) of the average tone of each country in articles mentionning: "country" "President (at that time period)" "Name" (e.g. "Germany " "chancellor" "Angela Merkel" if we are in the time period 2005-2018 and "Germany" "chancellor" "Gerhard Schr√∂der" 1998-2005)

Do we see generally differences between the countries (e.g. more negative for Russia than Germany)
Do we see pattern when the president changes?
Do we see a trend towards more negative emotions over the years?

# Questions to the TA

1. How old is the GDELT dataset in the cluster? When is it updated?
2. Do we have access to the 2300 emotions provided for each event? GDELT mentions that: "users interested in emotional measures use the Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records"
